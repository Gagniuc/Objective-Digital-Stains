Objective Digital Stains (DNA patterns)


The objective digital stain (ODS) is represented by a distribution of points
on a two-dimensional (2D) image, which reflects the information structure
inside a DNA/RNA sequence. In turn, the shape of the distribution pushes the
association of the method with a kind of “digital stain,” thus safely establishing
the name of the method. In the past, ODSs were simply called “DNA patterns.”
On ODSs, the information content (IC) is represented vertically on the y-axis
and the frequency of different letters is represented horizontally on the x-axis.
The overall idea surrounding this method is that similar distributions of two or
more DNA/RNA sequences may show similar functions. Interestingly, dissimilar
DNA/RNA sequences may show similar ODSs. This intriguing proprietary has
been demonstrated repeatedly over time. The first observation was made in
2012 in the journal BMC Genomics [269]. There, different ODS patterns have
been shown for eukaryotic gene promoters that indicate several generic classes
of promoters (more than 10 classes of promoters in eukaryotes). Moreover,
in 2013 in the same journal, a correlation was made between chromosomal
territories and ODS patterns shown by gene promoters [31]. More recently, in
2015, a publication in the journal PLoS ONE showed the connection between
ODSs of promoter sequences and the genes associated with type 1 and 2
diabetes [280]. This latest publication showed more clearly that ODSs are able
to link the DNA sequence characteristics to different biological functions.
