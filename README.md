# Objective Digital Stains

The objective digital stain (ODS) is represented by a distribution of points on a two-dimensional (2D) image, which reflects the information structure inside a DNA/RNA sequence. In turn, the shape of the distribution pushes the association of the method with a kind of “digital stain”, thus safely establishing the name of the method. In the past, ODSs were simply called <kbd>DNA patterns</kbd>. On ODSs, the information content (IC) is represented vertically on the <kbd>y-axis</kbd> and the frequency of different letters is represented horizontally on the <kbd>x-axis</kbd>. The overall idea surrounding this method is that similar distributions of two or more DNA/RNA sequences may show similar functions. Interestingly, dissimilar DNA/RNA sequences may show similar ODSs. This intriguing proprietary has been demonstrated repeatedly over time. The first observation was made in 2012 in the journal [BMC Genomics](https://bmcgenomics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2164-13-512). There, different ODS patterns have been shown for eukaryotic gene promoters that indicate several generic classes of promoters (more than 10 classes of promoters in eukaryotes). Moreover, in 2013 in [the same journal](https://bmcgenomics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2164-14-278), a correlation was made between chromosomal territories and ODS patterns shown by gene promoters. More recently, in 2015, [a publication](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4574929/) in the [journal PLoS ONE](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0137950) showed the connection between ODSs of promoter sequences and the genes associated with <kbd>type 1 and 2 diabetes</kbd>. This latest publication showed more clearly that ODSs are able to link the DNA sequence characteristics to different biological functions.
